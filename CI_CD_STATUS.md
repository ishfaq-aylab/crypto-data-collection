# CI/CD Status - Crypto Data Collection System

## ✅ **CI/CD is ENABLED and UPDATED**

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to work with the new Dubai deployment.

---

## 🔄 **What CI/CD Does**

When you push to the `main` branch, the workflow will:

1. **🧪 Run Tests** - Execute pytest tests and coverage
2. **🏗️ Build Docker Image** - Build and push to ECR in Dubai region
3. **🚀 Deploy to ECS** - Update the running service with new image
4. **✅ Health Check** - Verify the API is working after deployment
5. **📊 Test Endpoints** - Test key API endpoints to ensure functionality

---

## 📋 **Updated Configuration**

### Environment Variables
```yaml
AWS_REGION: me-central-1                    # Dubai region
ECR_REPOSITORY: crypto-data-api             # ECR repository name
ECS_SERVICE: crypto-api-service-dubai       # ECS service name
ECS_CLUSTER: crypto-data-cluster-dubai      # ECS cluster name
ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: crypto-api-task-dubai-v2  # Task definition
```

### Load Balancer Integration
- ✅ Uses Application Load Balancer instead of direct IP access
- ✅ Tests health through `crypto-alb-dubai-1902974409.me-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- ✅ Verifies all endpoints are working after deployment

---

## 🚀 **How to Trigger Deployment**

### Automatic Deployment
```bash
# Push to main branch (triggers CI/CD)
git add .
git commit -m "Update crypto data collection"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Or use the quick deploy script
./quick-deploy.sh
```

---

## 📊 **CI/CD Workflow Steps**

### 1. Test Phase
- ✅ Install Python 3.12
- ✅ Install dependencies from `requirements_production.txt`
- ✅ Run pytest tests with coverage
- ✅ Upload coverage to Codecov

### 2. Build Phase
- ✅ Configure AWS credentials for Dubai region
- ✅ Login to Amazon ECR
- ✅ Build Docker image with latest code
- ✅ Tag and push to ECR repository

### 3. Deploy Phase
- ✅ Download current task definition
- ✅ Update both containers (api-server & data-collection) with new image
- ✅ Deploy updated task definition to ECS
- ✅ Wait for service stability

### 4. Verification Phase
- ✅ Get Load Balancer DNS name
- ✅ Test health endpoint
- ✅ Test latest data endpoints
- ✅ Verify API functionality

---

## 🔐 **Required Secrets**

Make sure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:

1. **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`** - AWS access key for Dubai region
2. **`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`** - AWS secret key for Dubai region

### Setting up Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the AWS credentials as repository secrets

---

## 📈 **Deployment Benefits**

### Automatic Updates
- ✅ **Zero Downtime** - Rolling deployment with health checks
- ✅ **Automatic Testing** - Runs tests before deployment
- ✅ **Health Verification** - Ensures API is working after deployment
- ✅ **Rollback Capability** - Can revert to previous version if needed

### Monitoring
- ✅ **Build Status** - See deployment status in GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Test Results** - View test coverage and results
- ✅ **Deployment Logs** - Track deployment progress
- ✅ **Health Checks** - Verify API endpoints are working

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### To Enable Full CI/CD:

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # Add these to GitHub repository secrets:
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

2. **Test the Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change and push
   echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test CI/CD deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
   - Watch the "Deploy to AWS" workflow
   - Check deployment logs and health checks

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If CI/CD Fails:

1. **Check AWS Credentials** - Ensure secrets are correctly set
2. **Verify ECR Access** - Make sure credentials have ECR permissions
3. **Check ECS Permissions** - Ensure credentials can update ECS services
4. **Review Logs** - Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors

### Common Issues:

- **ECR Login Failed** → Check AWS credentials
- **ECS Update Failed** → Check ECS permissions
- **Health Check Failed** → Check load balancer configuration
- **Tests Failed** → Fix test issues before deployment
